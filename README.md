# Texts

Here stores some of the books and notes I write and/or typeset.

Generally speaking, if you donâ€™t see my name on the cover page of the corresponding PDF file, then I do not claim any copyright with respect to that work. This usually means that the original texts were not written by myself, in which case you may find the author information on the copyright page. However, I take full responsibility for the mistakes or typos appeared in the texts, and if you find any, please kindly inform me via GitHub issue or via the email ProjLib@outlook.com.
